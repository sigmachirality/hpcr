Functional implementation of the Penn Course Review Data API, written in Haskell using Servant.

### About

I don't think this will ever be run in production by Penn Labs, nor do I want it to. A major draw of Penn Labs is its focus on building apps up to par with industry standards, and Haskell is not industry standard. Check out the motivations section for more on why I'm building this!
